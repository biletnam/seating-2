This is the final version of my project to arrange seatings for students automatically.
The project is purely PHP based and it's made in a way that it doesn't require even MySQL.
MySQL is neglected by creating and handling temporary files in settings folder.
If the PHP files are not running download and view the sample input and output files to understand the overall process very breifly.
The sample input and output files are included in the example folder!
